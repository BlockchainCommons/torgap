# Blockchain Commons Torgap
<img src="images/logos/torgap.png" align="right">

**Torgap** is the Blockchain Commons architecture model for creating gaps between connected apps and microservices to support privacy, non-correlation, and censorship-resistance. 

## Additional Information

The following files contain…

* **[Torgap FAQ](Docs/FAQ.md)** — More info on what Torgaps are and why they're useful.

## Torgap Repos

### Quick Connect

Quick Connect is a service that creates a Torgap link between a Gordian Wallet and a full node.

* **[QuickConnect API](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Quick-Connect-API.md) \(specification\).** Connectivity specs.

We hope to extend the QuickConnect API to include links for Bitcoin mainnet, testnet, and signet, as well as Lightning and SpotBit, as early demos of the capability.

### Gordian Server

Networked Gordian services and microservices connect to the Gordian Wallet via Torgaps.

* **[Gordian](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) \(wallet services\).** A walet system built around a Torgap between the Gordian Wallet and Gordian Server.
* **[spotBit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit) \(online server\).** A Bitcoin pricing microservice.

### Torgap Onion Repos

Torgap Onion is an experiment that combines `minisig` ECC25519 keys with Tor to enable `did:onion` DID and VC services over a a Torgap.

* **[torgap-demo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-demo) \(CLI demo\).** A demonstration of how `torgap-sig-cli-rust` can be used to verify a signature using an onion service.
* **[torgap-sig](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-sig) \(Rust library\).** A fork of `rust-minisig` with support for Tor onion v3, testbedding `did:onion`, which enables DID and VCs lookups via a Torgap.
* **[torgap-sig-cli-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-sig-cli-rust) \(CLI tool\).** A fork of `rsign2` with support for Tor onion v3, with support for Tor onion v3, testbedding `did:onion`, which enables DID and VCs lookups via a Torgap.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.
